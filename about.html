    <h2>ðŸ‘¤ About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! Iâ€™m Yuntzu Wang, currently studying Electrical Engineering at Chang Gung University. My interests lie in embedded systems, mixed reality, and the intersection of healthcare and technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iâ€™ve developed projects using Unity + MRTK on HoloLens 2, built backend workflow automations using Google Apps Script, and am now exploring full-stack development through a backend internship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through volunteer service in rural education and non-profit administration, Iâ€™ve cultivated teamwork, system-building, and communication skills. This site is a showcase of my journey.
