    <h2>ðŸ‘¤ About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! Iâ€™m Yuntzu Wang, currently studying Electrical Engineering at Chang Gung University in Taiwan. My passion lies at the intersection of embedded systems, human-computer interaction, and education technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on several interdisciplinary projectsâ€”ranging from using HoloLens 2 for mixed reality surgical navigation, to developing internal automation systems for nonprofits using Google Apps Script. Through these experiences, I've learned to bridge software and hardware to solve real-world problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey isnâ€™t just about engineering; I also care deeply about education and service. Iâ€™ve contributed over 930 hours of volunteer work, co-leading outreach programs in rural schools and supporting the backend operations of Teach For Taiwan. These roles taught me how to plan, communicate, and improve workflows for impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      What excites me the most is applying engineering to help peopleâ€”whether thatâ€™s through smarter tools, better systems, or more inclusive design. Iâ€™m now diving deeper into backend development, hoping to combine frontend, backend, and embedded experiences into something meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy listening to K-pop music and visiting exhibitions. This site is a small reflection of my learning path and aspirations.
