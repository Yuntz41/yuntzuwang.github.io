    <h2>ðŸŒ± Volunteer Experience</h2>
    <p>
      From 2021 to 2024, I have accumulated over <strong>930 hours</strong> of volunteer service through activities such as organizing educational outreach events for rural elementary schools, assisting in mental health facilities, and supporting nonprofit operations at <strong>Teach for Taiwan (TFT)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my time with TFT, I served as an <strong>Organizational Operations Assistant</strong>, where I helped plan, execute, and improve internal logistics and data systems. My contributions included managing mailing logistics, workspace organization, device tracking, and the development of tools to automate workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
      A major part of my work involved using <strong>Google Apps Script</strong> to build internal systems such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A volunteer book borrowing and return tracking system</li>
      <li>A spreadsheet-powered training record generator for Google Docs and Calendar</li>
      <li>A resource application management tool to streamline backend coordination</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These experiences sharpened my technical skills while teaching me how to collaborate in mission-driven environments. I learned to communicate across departments, understand stakeholder needs, and iterate on feedback to improve tools for real-world use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond office automation, I also co-led service-learning initiatives with Spring Radiance Club, coordinating over 50 students to design and run educational programs for children in rural areas and hospitals. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of social responsibility and team leadership.
